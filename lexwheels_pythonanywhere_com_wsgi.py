# This file contains the WSGI configuration required to serve up your
# web application at http://lexwheels.pythonanywhere.com/
# It works by setting the variable 'application' to a WSGI handler of some

# +++++++++++ GENERAL DEBUGGING TIPS +++++++++++
# getting imports and sys.path right can be fiddly!
# We've tried to collect some general tips here:
# https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/DebuggingImportError

# Below are templates for Django and Flask.  You should update the file
# appropriately for the web framework you're using, and then
# click the 'Reload /yourdomain.com/' button on the 'Web' tab to make your site
# live.

# +++++++++++ VIRTUALENV +++++++++++
# If you want to use a virtualenv, set its path on the web app setup tab.
# Then come back here and import your application object as per the
# instructions below


# +++++++++++ CUSTOM WSGI +++++++++++
# If you have a WSGI file that you want to serve using PythonAnywhere, perhaps
# in your home directory under version control, then use something like this:
#
#import sys
#
#path = '/home/lexwheels/path/to/my/app
#if path not in sys.path:
#    sys.path.append(path)
#
#from my_wsgi_file import application  # noqa


# +++++++++++ FLASK +++++++++++
# Flask works like any other WSGI-compatible framework, we just need
# to import the application.  Often Flask apps are called "app" so we
# may need to rename it during the import:


import sys

# The "/home/lexwheels" below specifies your home
# directory -- the rest should be the directory you uploaded your Flask
# code to underneath the home directory.  So if you just ran
# "git clone git@github.com/myusername/myproject.git"
# ...or uploaded files to the directory "myproject", then you should
# specify "/home/lexwheels/myproject"

path = '/home/lexwheels/flask_hello'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

from main import app as application  # noqa

# NB -- many Flask guides suggest you use a file called run.py; that's
# not necessary on PythonAnywhere.  And you should make sure your code
# does *not* invoke the flask development server with app.run(), as it
# will prevent your wsgi file from working.
